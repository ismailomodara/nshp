      '<p>The dream of the average person is to afford a decent and affordable home while being able to meet other basic needs. While this desire rests within most individuals, it’s realization is often short lived as the economic resources required to achieve this aspiration is not within reach. This consequently resulted in the emergence of slum settlements as decent housing seems to be outside the reach of many low income earners.</p>' +
      '<p>In sub-saharan Africa where the cost of housing is relatively high, it is often a luxury to own a home despite the basic nature of shelter needs. The situation is more dire for low income earners who have other needs such as food and clothing to consider before making any investments in house ownership.</p>' +
      '<p>Owning a home is indeed a Nigerian dream as most people share this aspiration, hoping it becomes a reality with time. This dream is often short circuited as the demands of the time makes it difficult for them to bear the financial responsibility that comes with owning a home. From land purchase to construction of houses, it’s capital intensive nature makes home ownership a distant prospect.</p>' +
      '<p>Those who can afford to own homes are often at the high end of the spectrum who lease them out at exorbitant costs making it difficult for low income earners to afford. Little wonder why there is proliferation of slum settlements where its dwellers share facilities and live in unsanitary conditions.</p>' +
      '<p>It is indeed a new dawn for Nigerians as a ray of hope has shone its light on low income earners with the launch of the National Social Housing Programme (NSHP). This was initiated to provide decent and affordable homes for low income earners who face housing challenges and economic difficulties. With a disbursement of 200 billion issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on behalf of the government, Nigerians in shared facilities and unsanitary conditions will have the opportunity to own decent low cost houses.</p>' +
      '<p>Starting this year, 300,000 homes will be constructed in all states of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Interestingly, with the <a href="https://fhfl.com.ng/" target="_blank">Family Homes Funds (FHF)</a> as the lead developer, other Nigerian partnerships and collaborations are welcomed to facilitate the construction of these homes. The implication of which is the creation of over 1.5 million jobs for Nigerians across the construction value chain.</p>' +
      '<p>The drive towards providing social housing for Nigerians will ultimately reduce the socioeconomic challenges that emerge from the development of slum settlements. This is in consonance with the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11" target="_blank">Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs 11)</a> aimed at making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.</p>' +
      '<p>More than a project, this initiative will help the average low income earner realize their Nigerian dreams. Consequently a more inclusive and resilient society is achieved where the aspirations of its people are validated.</p>',
