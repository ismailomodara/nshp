                    National Social Housing Programme (NSHP) is a bold response
                    by the Buhari-led administration to tackle the adverse
                    economic and health challenges faced by Nigerians due to the
                    global pandemic.<br />
                    The Family Homes Funds has been commissioned to implement
                    the Social Housing Program as an integral part of The
                    Federal Governmentâ€™s Economic Sustainability Plan.<br />
                    The NSHP introduces a new and dynamic approach that brings
                    together experience and expertise from multiple stakeholders
                    to develop a sustainable and impactful solution to housing
                    and unemployment in Nigeria.

                    The NSHP homes are built with good quality materials, with
                    adequate spacing and the necessary facilities for decent
                    living. These apartments are detached and sit on at least
                    250sqm, which can be extended at minimal cost

                    also to allow you choose your preferred location.

                    The NSHP is set to provide low cost housing for Nigerians
                    within the low income range and as such, allocation will be
                    through a transparent process which will ensure that those
                    who qualify receive their due allocation. A person will not
                    be allocated more than one house at a time
