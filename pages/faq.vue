                    National Social Housing Programme (NSHP) is a bold response
                    by the Buhari-led administration to tackle the adverse
                    economic and health challenges faced by Nigerians due to the
                    global COVID-19 pandemic.<br />
                    The Family Homes Funds has been commissioned to implement
                    the Social Housing Program as an integral part of The
                    Federal Governmentâ€™s Economic Sustainability Plan.<br />
                    The NSHP introduces a new and dynamic approach that brings
                    together experience and expertise from multiple stakeholders
                    to develop a sustainable and impactful solution to housing
                    and unemployment in Nigeria.

                    Our objective is to ensure that Nigerians with low or medium
                    income especially in the informal sector have access to
                    homes they can afford.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To meet this objective, we have designed an extendible
                    1-bedroom self-contained apartment with a living/dining
                    room, kitchen store, bedroom and two toilets. These
                    apartments are detached and sits on at least 250sqm and can
                    be extended to 2/3 bedrooms at minimal costs.

                    The houses will be built in all states in Nigeria including

                    be informed as new projects are built. This is also to allow
                    you choose your preferred location.

                    The NSHP is set to provide low cost housing for Nigerians
                    within the low income range and as such, allocation of
                    houses will be free and fair. A person will not be allocated
                    more than one house at a time.
